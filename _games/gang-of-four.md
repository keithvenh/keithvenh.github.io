## Object of the Game

The object of the game is to dispose of all the cards in your hand before any of your fellow players get rid of theirs. After one player has no more cards, the hand is finished and points are assessed by counting the number of cards in the remaining players' hands. Play continues until one or more players reaches a total of 100 points and the game is over. The player with the lowest total number of points is the winner.

## Playing the Game

Deal the entire deck to the four players (16 cards per person). It is recommended that you sort your hand by rank (1-10, Phoenix, Dragon) and color (green, yellow, red) within each rank before starting play.

### Beginning Play

At the beginning of play, the player with the multi-colored 1 starts by playing a combination of one to five cards, which must include the multi-colored one. In subsequent hands, the winner of the previous hand always plays first.

Each player then in turn, plays a combination of cards made of the same number of cards as the opening combination in a higher rank, or passes.

- Single Cards (Green 1 to Red Dragon)
- Pairs (Two 1s to Two Phoenix)
- Three of a Kind (Three 1s to Three 10s)
